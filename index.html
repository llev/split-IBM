            <h2>History of design at IBM</h2>
            <blockquote>The stripes of the IBM logo serve primarily as an attention-getting device. They take commonplace letters out of the realm of the ordinary. They are memorable. They suggest efficiency and speed.</blockquote><h5>– Paul Rand</h5>

            <p>International Business Machines Corporation is one of the oldest, largest and most recognisable technology companies, in the world, thanks in part to the visionary work of Paul Rand. Thomas Watson Jr, the son of IBM's founder made it his mission to transform their scattered brand image and hired Eliot Noyes, architect and industrial designer, formerly of New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Noyes recruited a design supergroup, consisting of Charles and Ray Eames for scenography, publications, videos, Eero Saarinen for the architecture and Paul Rand for the graphics. Their mission was to create a cohesive and contemporary brand, identifiable throughout every aspect of the business. The company has built upon the strong foundations' Rand and the rest laid and built one of the most robust and understated design languages, a comprehensive modern design system, focused around a solid design philosophy.</p>
            <blockquote>Good design is good business</blockquote><h5>– Thomas Watson Jr</h5>
        <p>
            In 1956 Paul Rand began work on one of the largest branding projects in history, lasting decades. It just so happened to be Rand's first full branding project. The iconic eight-bar logomark wasn't implemented until 1972, sixteen years after he began. An interview between Miggs B. and Paul Rand from 1991 informed my approach to brand design, more than anything else before or since. In the interview, Rand commented that people often think that the goal of a logo is to illustrate what the business does. The most important aspect is how attention-grabbing it is. The eight-bar logo evolved over many years from the modest beginnings of Rand's modernised update of the existing logo. The bold slab serif, City medium, designed by Georg Trump – no relation – represented modernity, the solid & balanced, minimalist typeface was the anchor that grounded and connected much of the brand identity. Rand, the iconic modernist designer, pushed his designs and the boundaries of corporate identity over the years to come. The first striped version, – with thirteen stripes – didn't come until 1962.

            <blockquote>Design is a conflict between form and content. Content is the idea. Form is how you treat the idea, what you do with it.</blockquote>
            <h5>– Paul Rabnd</h5>
            <p>In the interview Rand discusses his approach of creating a design that is reminiscent of the old logo, to maintain the recognition and not shock the end-user, being the general public. This inspired approach enabled Rand to evolve the logo with the full backing of the directors, through to every member of staff. Each update iterated and improved upon the last, design choices were documented and explained in such notorious detail, that Rand managed to rally every person to take the new cohesive brand seriously. Something that many design firms & businesses struggle with to this day.</p>

        <p>Part of the reason for the successful adoption of the brand is the painstaking Graphic Standards Manuals Rand would produce for every design change across the brand. The roots of which can still be seen in IBM's outstanding carbon design system. Rand produced several guidelines regarding the "use and abuse" of the logo and brand identity. These detailed documents helped gather adoption and have since become coveted collector's items. A successful Kickstarter campaign was funded to gather content from the guides in circulation, accessible for designers to use as inspiration. The brand guide is now thought of as commonplace but these documents were a pioneering and clever part of the evolving industry of branding. Inside the Graphic Standards, Manuals would be the story the brand's evolution, logomarks and acceptable variants, colours, how to use the typography, City medium and Helvetica, stationery, signage and much more. Every customer interaction point was documented and designed for, with incredible detail and flawless layouts.
        </p>
        <h3>The business world took notice</h3>
        <p>Effective branding has such a unifying impact on IBM's brand image. So much so, it spurred many businesses to follow in their footsteps. Some of which would go on to hire Paul Rand. This is another important factor in the success of the IBM brand. The business world took notice. Brands aren't in communication with their audience alone. If branding is how people perceive your business, then how other financial giants rank in comparison, is a factor in business success.</p>
        <p>
            IBM now had a bold modernist brand image, with a vast colour palette and creative layout applied across all of their marketing material. Brilliantly simple packaging helped the brand shine, this was the beginning of the tech 'product as experience'. A box containing carbon paper would be treated with equal care as the box wrapping your personal computer or printer. These contrasting blue and white boxes are as effective now as when they were first designed, Zeiss, the premium lens manufacturer has packaging almost indistinguishable from these early branded items.</p>

            <blockquote>Perception is reality, reality is not reality, it’s only what people think. That’s one of the reasons it’s so difficult to be a designer.</blockquote>
            <h5>– Paul Rabnd</h5>
            <p>The iterations of the brand mark weren't arbitrary. Every minor design change over the years was deliberate and considerate. The tripes that came to represent 'speed and efficiency' were born of typographic attention to detail. Rand implemented the thirteen stripes initially because the gradual weight increase of the letterforms created an uncomfortable open-ended feel.</p>
        <p>The horizontal graphical element anchored the three characters and made the abbreviated logo feel like a graphic mark, it was less about the three letters that formed the logo, became a symbol. It came to signify many things as people would attach meaning to the identity. Something Rand would highlight in the interview with Miggs B. The striped logo further updated and finalised in 1972 with eight bars was designed because scanners and home printers would struggle to produce the logo accurately.</p>
        <p>It goes to show that a design is never perfect and iteration is always a crucial part of the design process. The eight-bar logo that remains the same today, came to represent, not only IBM but computing and technology. One of the reasons designers have so much interest in this project why the brand guides have been collated and reprinted is how one typographic logomark could come to represent so much.</p>
        <blockquote>There's nothing about the IBM symbol that suggests computers, just what the viewer reads into it. Stripes are associated with computers because the initials of a great computer company happen to be stripes.</blockquote>
        <h5>– Paul Rabnd</h5>
        <p>The versatility of the exhaustive, precise brand identity is one of the key factors in its success. The brand is so enduring that much of the marketing campaigns coming out of IBM and the design agencies working with them, revolve around the stripes. Packaging sporting, multicoloured, graceful vertical pinstripes. Modern, specially built advertisements that act as functional parts of the environment and ads simultaneously. Giant striped poster that curves off the wall to act as a bench and an inverted version acting as a shelter from the rain. The iconic EYE BEE M poster designed by Rand has been updated to reflect the inclusive working environment at IBM. Pride colours decorate the eight bars of the logo. Office, Ogilvy and Pentagram are some of the leading agencies that have relied heavily on the heritage of the brand identity to create modern designs.</p>
        <blockquote>Drawing on the company’s illustrious design heritage and product history, the project team explored the colours, shapes, frameworks, and combinations that would best communicate IBM branding.</blockquote>

                <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
                <p>What draws me to IBM and their design language, is not the inspiring branding of Paul Rand but the way IBM has built upon the meticulous approach to attention to detail to become a leader in modern design systems, a modern aspect of the brand identity. Design systems are a living document of the implementation of a brand across digital products. As digital has become a driving force in the economy, brand application has become more complex and fractured.</p>
            <p>Teams across giant corporations like IBM are multinational, vast and siloed. Not to mention that many of these technology companies aren't working on every product that will be associated with the brand. The app store apps have to feel cohesive and represent apple, Shopify stores have to maintain the Shopify image... Digital products are never finished, the way a print project is, there's constant movement, testing and development. </p>
            <p>Maintaining consistency has become infinitely more complicated since the days of Paul Rand. To combat this, corporations have begun creating design language, design systems, interface guidelines, digital products that contain the parameters of the brand and how it's used. Meta.</p>
            <blockquote>Empathy is our foundation, always. Now it’s more important than ever.</blockquote>
            <h5>– IBM</h5>
            <p>The difference between a brand guide and a design system is that a design system contains working code, accessibility, design tools, user interface design kits, and every detail on the digital life of a brand. There are many corporations creating design systems. Shopify has a Polaris, Air BnB have Design Language System (DLS), Apple, Human Interface Guidelines. But IBM has one of the most comprehensive and expansive approaches to digital brand design. </p>

                <p>The vision of Thomas Watson Jr. is more alive than ever. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="blank">ibm.com/design</a> Is a branding and design paradise, that embraces their Paul Rand brand identity. The IBM favicon is the Rand bee, and one of the first things you'll see on the website is the Eye Bee M graphic. This encyclopedia of IBM design covers everything from their design principles, approach to systems design and design thinking, the IBM design language, and entire websites on the three disciplines of Product, Digital and Event design.</p>
    
            <p>The aesthetic experience of the modern IBM design language <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="blank">ibm.com/design</a> feels like an evolution of the Graphic Standards Manuals Rand meticulously produced. The IBM copy font has been updated from Helvetica to 'IBM Plex' a versatile workhorse consisting of Sans, Mono, Serif and condensed variations. The font is open-source on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fonts.google.com</a> and is the copy for this page. How the font's are to be used is laid out in detail, with usable code, interface specs and the story behind the typeface. Another consistency with the brand guidelines of old.

                    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Great design can have a transformative effect on a business and that is proof in the way design has infiltrated every aspect of IBM and the technology industry as a whole. The company's brand was pioneering and inspired the design revolution, paving the way for companies like Apple. They have remained true to their brand while building upon it to meet the modern demands of a dynamic digital brand experience.</p>
                <p>The IBM identity began as a vibrant and versatile brand that pushed the boundaries of corporate design, they are still at the forefront of design within the technology industry. The early designs were practical and came to represent an entire industry. Over time IBM has refined and modernised their design language.</p>
                <p>This case study has highlighted several underrated aspects of branding in my opinion. Meaning is attached to the branding after association with a product or service. Branding should be versatile enough to withstand people attaching differing opinions to the identity and today a brand should be a living entity, fluid and practical.</p>
                <p>Every design decision down to the spacing between line hight should be considered and if there's scope, tested through digital media. If Paul Rand was making tweaks to the brand when there was a final printed product, it's sensible to think that, in today's digital environment, the days of a branding agency handing over a final document that contains the entire <i>brand</i> are over. It's only a matter of time until every industry catches up Rand's pioneering approach to the brand.</p>
                <i>The layout of this website was inspired by the brand guide designed by Paul Rand and the typography and colours are taken from the IBM design system.</i>
